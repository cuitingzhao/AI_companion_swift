# Call me TZ in the chat
# Principles: 
- **Never make any assumptions!!!** You should always have a check on existing project structure and code instead!
- Very important! Run next_task.py script using pythong3 in the python_script folder at the end of your every single task/reply. It is a script for me to instruct you the next task. It is a key to help me do more things using one credit. 
- Your task is to implement code, not to suggest unless you are explicily asked not to modify code.
- Do NOT search multiple files at the same time but to do it STEP by STEP 
# Tips: 
- Use `codebase_search` instead of `grep_search` for better context-aware searching.
